* Deploying the multisig program

** Install the solana toolchain and anchor toolchain

** Clone the [[https://github.com/Eclipse-Laboratories-Inc/multisig][multisig]] repo

** Install the dependencies

#+begin_src sh
  npm install
#+end_src

** Check the key for the program

#+begin_src sh
  anchor keys list
#+end_src

** Replace the old key with the key above

In the files =Anchor.toml= and =programs/multisig/src/lib.rs=

** Replace the [provider] parameters

Replace ~cluster~ with the address to the eclipse network

Replace ~wallet~ with the private key of the wallet that's deploying
the program

Replace ~wallet_pub~ with the pubkey of the wallet that's deploying
the program

* Create the multisig account

** Create the signer keys

I recommend creating at least 3 keys with ~solana-keygen~. Also fund
them with some tokens.

** Take note of their addresses

** Call the multisig client

#+begin_src sh
  npx ts-node client/index.ts --owners <first address> --owners <second address> --owners <third address> --connectionUrl <eclipse url>
#+end_src

Take note of the pubkey generated

* Run a relayer for each signer key

The new configuration fields are
- =multisig_program_id= (the address of the multisig program)
- =multisig= (the pubkey generated by the multisig client)
- =refundee= (it can be the address of the =solana_payer=)
- =signer_keypair_file= (the signer key for this relayer)
